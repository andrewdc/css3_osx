# CSS3 OSX Window

I built this using a rapid prototype tool called StaticMatic, but it is essentially pure CSS and HTML. The Source languages are Haml and Sass, and I used a behavior file to help get Internet Explorer up to speed with the times. No Images are used.

## /src

This contains all of the code that I wrote.

## /site

Here you will find the generated HTML and CSS created by StaticMatic.
